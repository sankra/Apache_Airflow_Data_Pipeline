ðŸš€Dynamic DAGs in Apache Airflow
Dynamic DAGs are DAGs that are generated programmatically at runtimeâ€”useful when you have multiple similar workflows (e.g., one per client, dataset, or table), and donâ€™t want to write duplicate DAG code.

ðŸ§  Use Cases for Dynamic Airflow:
1. Process multiple S3 buckets or tables
2. Multi-tenant pipelines
3. File ingestion DAGs
4. Parameterized ETL pipelines
5. Set up the automation for dataengineering tasks.
